-Big O notation for execution time and memory usage
-Constant time can be slow, but equally slow all the time
-linear time = as input increases run time increases by the same amount
-n squared = quadratic time
-for large n linear time is always faster than n squared
-log time repeatedly drops half the comparisons
-quasilinear time = sort method in kotlin O(n log n)
-polynomial time, exponential time, factorial time
